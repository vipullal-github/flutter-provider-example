# flutter_provider_example

A simple bare-bones provider example to innustrate clearly the use of the provider package for state management.

## Code analysis

This description assumes that you have a basic uderstanding of Flutter stateful and stateless widgets. 

The provider package is the simplest and the most elegent package in Flutter world for state management.

If you look at the basic project generated by:
```
  flutter create --project-name ...
```
It has a MyHomePage stateful widget. Here the "state" is a simple integer value, but in a real world application, this would be the data needed by your application. For example, if you were writing a Todo app, your state would be the list of Todo's.

This project takes the counter example and uses a provider package to do the state managent. 

In order to understand the provider package, you need to understand three key classes, viz:
1. ChangeNotifier
2. ChangeNotifierProvider
3. Consumer

### ChangeNotifier
The class which manages the state must inherit from ChangeNotifier class or it may use the with clause. In the present example, this is CounterProvider class. 

### ChangeNotifierProvider
This class MUST be the parent of the tree to which the state data needs to be made available.

In the present example, this is done in main.dart:

```
Widget _wrapHomePageWithProvider() {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider<CounterProvider>(
      create: (context) => CounterProvider(),
      builder: (context, child) => const HomePage(),
    );
  }
```
The ChangeNotifierProvider requires us to provide a create function and a builder function. The create function should instantiate the provider class and the builder function should build the widget.
